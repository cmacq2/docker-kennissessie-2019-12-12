# Docker security kennissessie.

Welcome to the excersises of the Docker security knowledge sharing session. You can find the presentation given earlier at http://dockersecurity.staq.info/#/. 

If you not yet have an VM setup, you can follow the guide over [here](./VM.md). If you are using the VM provided by the course you can login using the credentials: 

```
un: experiments
pw: experiments
```

the experiments user is a member of the sudo group, but you can also `su` into the root account, the root user has the same password as the experiments user. 

If you would like to access the VM using SSH you can log in to the machine and resolve the IP address of the host-only network using the `ip addr` command.
